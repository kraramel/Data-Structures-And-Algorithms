# Data Structures And Algorithms
## Introduction 

This a simple repository where i will try to write implementation of the data structures i will learn. The choice of the programming language is still a mystery for me. I will decide by the time i begin.

## Big O

First i'm going to ask you this question : What is a good code ? Well the answer is that the code must be :
1. Readable
2. Scalable

Readability means that your code is generally clean, and others can easily understand it.

Scalable is related to our subject **Big O** . Big O allows us to measure the idea of scalable code. And it reflects the relation between the number of elements that we put as an input in a function and the number of operations that the function needs in order to get the results.

If you want to learn more about this subject you can check this [**Big-O cheat sheet**](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).

But keep in mind that "_**Optimal optimization can be the root of all evil**_".

## How to solve problems

Before we dive into coding problems, data structures and algorithms and all of these fun coding details. we must first  understand this one principle : **How to solve problems** . In this section we are going to talk about technical interviews and how to succeed in them.

First we need to know what companies are looking for. Most people tend to think it's just technical skills. But there is actually four things : 
1. **Analytic Skills**
2. **Coding Skills**
3. **Technical Skills**
4. **Communication skills**

**Analytic Skills** : It is how you can think through a problem and analyzethings. And when you're coding during an interview, they want to hear your tought process and how you go from not  knowing the answer to solving the problem

**Coding Skills** : Is your coding is clean, organized and readable

**Technical Skills** : Do you know the fundamentals, do you understand the pros and cons of different solutions.

**Communication Skills** : Are you going to fit well and work well in the company.
